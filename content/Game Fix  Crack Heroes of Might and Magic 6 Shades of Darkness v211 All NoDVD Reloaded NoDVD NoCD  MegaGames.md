Might and Magic Heroes VI: Shades of Darkness is a standalone expansion for the acclaimed turn-based strategy game Might and Magic Heroes VI. It was released in 2013 by Ubisoft and developed by Virtuos. It features two new campaigns, one for the Dungeon faction and one for the Necropolis faction, each with their own unique storyline, heroes, units and gameplay mechanics.
 
The Dungeon campaign follows the Dark Elves of Malassa, the Dragon Goddess of Darkness, as they seek to become masters of deception, stealth and assassination. They are led by Raelag, a returning hero from Heroes V, who must face his past and decide the fate of his people. The Dungeon faction has a new lineup of seven creatures, such as the Assassin, the Shadow Lurker and the Shadow Dragon. They also have a new ability called Shroud of Malassa, which allows them to hide their towns and heroes from enemy sight.

The Necropolis campaign tells the story of Vein, a young Necromancer who is chosen by the Spider Queen to lead her cult against a mysterious enemy. He must prove himself worthy of her favor and survive the trials of darkness. The Necropolis faction has four new creatures, such as the Lamasu, the Fate Weaver and the Grim Reaper. They also have a new ability called Tears of Asha, which allows them to collect tears from enemy heroes and use them to summon powerful avatars of the Spider Queen.

Shades of Darkness is a compelling conclusion to the Heroes VI experience and an indispensable addition to every fanâs collection. It offers hours of challenging and immersive gameplay, with a rich and dark fantasy setting. It is also an ideal way to discover the critically acclaimed gameplay of Heroes VI for newcomers, as it does not require the base game to play.
  
Shades of Darkness also adds new features and improvements to the Heroes VI gameplay. It introduces a new reputation system, which allows the player to choose between two paths for each faction: Blood or Tears. Depending on the path chosen, the player will unlock different abilities and bonuses for their heroes and units. For example, the Dungeon faction can choose between the Path of the Dragon or the Path of the Spider, while the Necropolis faction can choose between the Path of the Necromancer or the Path of the Cultist.
 
Another new feature is the Dynasty Weapon, which is a powerful artifact that can be equipped by any hero of the same faction. The Dynasty Weapon grows in power as the player progresses through the campaign and unlocks new abilities. For example, the Dungeon faction has the Soulreaver Staff, which can drain mana from enemies and cast spells for free, while the Necropolis faction has the Staff of Ashaâs Eightfold, which can summon spiders and deal damage over time.
 
Shades of Darkness also enhances the graphics and sound of Heroes VI, with new animations, effects and music. The game also supports Steam achievements and cloud saving. The game has received mostly positive reviews from critics and players alike, who praised its story, gameplay and atmosphere. Some of the drawbacks mentioned were the lack of multiplayer content, some technical issues and bugs, and the high difficulty level.
