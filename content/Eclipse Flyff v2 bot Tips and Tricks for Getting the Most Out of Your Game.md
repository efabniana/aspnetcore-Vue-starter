## How to Use a Bot Safely in Eclipse Flyff
 
Using a bot in Eclipse Flyff can be tempting, but also dangerous. If you are caught using a bot by the server staff or other players, you may face serious consequences, such as a ban, a wipe, a report or a loss of reputation. Therefore, you should use a bot safely and responsibly, following these tips:

1. **Choose a reliable and updated bot**: Not all bots are created equal. Some bots may be outdated, buggy, detected or infected with viruses or malware. You should choose a bot that is reliable, updated and compatible with the latest version of Eclipse Flyff. You should also scan your bot for any malicious files before using it.
2. **Use a proxy or VPN**: A proxy or VPN can help you hide your IP address and location from the server and other players. This can make it harder for them to track you down or report you for using a bot. However, you should also be careful about the proxy or VPN service you use, as some of them may be unreliable, slow or compromised.
3. **Use a secondary account**: Using a bot on your main account can be risky, as you may lose all your progress and items if you get banned or wiped. You should use a secondary account for botting, and transfer your items and penya to your main account periodically. You should also avoid using the same email or password for both accounts.
4. **Use a bot sparingly and smartly**: Using a bot too often or too obviously can raise suspicion and attract attention from the server staff and other players. You should use a bot sparingly and smartly, such as avoiding crowded areas, changing locations frequently, taking breaks occasionally, using human-like settings and behaviors, and avoiding interactions with other players while botting.
5. **Follow the server rules and respect other players**: Using a bot does not give you the right to break the server rules or disrespect other players. You should follow the server rules and terms of service carefully and respect them. You should not use a bot to harm or harass other players or to gain an unfair advantage over them. You should also be prepared to face the consequences if you get caught using a bot.

Using a bot in Eclipse Flyff can be fun and rewarding, but also risky and unethical. You should use a bot safely and responsibly, following these tips and your own common sense. You should also remember that using a bot is not the only way to enjoy Eclipse Flyff. You can also play the game normally and have fun with your friends and guildmates.
