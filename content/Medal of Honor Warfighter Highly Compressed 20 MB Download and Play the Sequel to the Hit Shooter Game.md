IGN gave the game a score of 4 out of 10, calling it a \"dishonorable discharge\" and stating that \"Medal of Honor Warfighterâs core design is deeply problematic, and technical issues only cut into it deeper\"[^3^]. GameSpot gave the game a score of 6 out of 10, saying that \"Medal of Honor Warfighter doesn't merge its cliched parts into a satisfying whole, making it just another middle-of-the-road military shooter\".

Some critics also expressed concern over the game's portrayal of real-life conflicts and events. The BBC reported that Pakistani officials were angered by the game's depiction of Pakistan as a failed state and a haven for terrorists. The Philippine government also condemned the game for showing its capital city Manila as a war zone and a breeding ground for Abu Sayyaf militants. EA defended the game by saying that it was \"based on real-world events\" and that it had \"worked directly with Tier 1 Operators ... to create a respectful tribute to their service\".
