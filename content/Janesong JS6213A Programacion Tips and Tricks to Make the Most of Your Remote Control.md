## Manual Code Entry Method
 
The manual code entry method allows you to enter the device code manually using the number keys on your remote. You can find the device codes for different brands and models in the user manual of your Janesong JS-6213A remote control. Here are the steps to program your remote using the manual code entry method:
 
1. Turn on the device you want to control with your remote.
2. Press and hold the SET button on your remote until the LED indicator flashes twice.
3. Press the device button (TV, DVD, CBL, etc.) that corresponds to the device you want to control.
4. Enter the four-digit device code using the number keys on your remote. The LED indicator will flash twice if the code is valid.
5. Point your remote at the device and press the POWER button to test if it works. If it does, you have successfully programmed your remote. If not, try another code or use the auto search method.

## Auto Search Method
 
The auto search method allows you to scan through all the available device codes until you find the one that works with your device. This method is useful if you don't have the device code or if the manual code entry method fails. Here are the steps to program your remote using the auto search method:

1. Turn on the device you want to control with your remote.
2. Press and hold the SET button on your remote until the LED indicator flashes twice.
3. Press the device button (TV, DVD, CBL, etc.) that corresponds to the device you want to control.
4. Press and hold the POWER button on your remote. The LED indicator will flash once and then start scanning through the device codes.
5. When your device turns off, release the POWER button and press it again to turn it back on. Check if all the functions on your remote work with your device. If they do, you have successfully programmed your remote. If not, repeat steps 4 and 5 until you find a code that works.
