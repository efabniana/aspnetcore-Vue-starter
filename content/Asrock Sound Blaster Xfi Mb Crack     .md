## What is Sound Blaster X-Fi MB?
 
Sound Blaster X-Fi MB is a software suite that simulates the features and effects of a Sound Blaster X-Fi sound card on PC systems with basic onboard audio. It can improve the sound quality of games, music and movies by applying various audio processing technologies, such as:
 
- X-Fi Crystalizer: This technology restores the details and vibrance that are lost during the compression process of audio formats like mp3 and wma. It can make your music sound more crisp and clear, and your movies sound more realistic and dynamic.
- X-Fi CMSS-3D: This technology creates virtual surround sound from any stereo source, such as headphones or speakers. It can enhance the spatial awareness and immersion of your games and movies by simulating realistic 3D sound effects.
- EAX ADVANCED HD 4.0: This technology provides advanced environmental audio effects for games that support it. It can create realistic soundscapes with reverberation, occlusion, obstruction and other effects that match the game environment.
- THX TruStudio PC: This technology provides additional audio enhancements for games, music and movies, such as Smart Volume, Dialog Plus, Surround and Bass.
