Hitman is a 2007 action movie based on the popular video game series of the same name. The movie stars Timothy Olyphant as Agent 47, a professional assassin who works for a mysterious organization known as The Agency. Agent 47 is hired to kill a Russian politician, but soon finds himself in a web of intrigue and betrayal, pursued by both Interpol and the Russian military. Along the way, he meets a woman named Nika (Olga Kurylenko), who becomes his unlikely ally.
 
The movie is directed by Xavier Gens and features impressive action sequences, such as shootouts, car chases, and hand-to-hand combat. The movie also stays faithful to the video game's aesthetics, such as Agent 47's signature bald head, barcode tattoo, and red tie. The movie also explores Agent 47's origins and personality, showing him as a cold-blooded but efficient killer who follows a strict code of conduct.

The movie received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the video game. Some praised the movie for its entertainment value and Olyphant's performance, while others criticized the movie for its weak plot, poor dialogue, and lack of character development. Roger Ebert gave the movie two stars out of four and wrote: "What I found intriguing about the movie was the lonely self-sufficiency of Agent 47, his life without a boyhood, his lack of a proper name, his single-purpose training."[^1^] However, he also noted that some scenes were "no doubt from the video game" and involved Agent 47 "shooting down opponents who come dressed as Jedi troopers in black".
 
The movie has a 16% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Hitman features the unfortunate combination of excessive violence, incoherent plot, and inane dialogue."[^2^] On the other hand, the movie has a 57% audience score based on over 250,000 ratings, indicating that some viewers enjoyed the movie despite its flaws. The movie was a moderate success at the box office, grossing over $100 million worldwide on a $24 million budget.
 
The movie was followed by a sequel, Hitman: Agent 47, in 2015 with a different cast and director. The sequel received even worse reviews than the original and was a commercial flop. It is unclear if there will be another Hitman movie in the future, but fans of the video game can still enjoy playing the latest installment, Hitman 3, which was released in 2021 and received critical acclaim.
