## Creating Sounds with DiscoDSP Discovery Pro
 
One of the best things about DiscoDSP Discovery Pro is that it comes with over 5,000 presets that cover a wide range of genres and styles. You can browse through the presets by category, such as bass, lead, pad, sequence, drum, FX, and more. You can also search for presets by name or by bank. Each preset has a description that tells you what kind of sound it is and how to use it. You can also see the parameters that are assigned to the modulation wheel and the aftertouch for each preset.
 
Of course, you can also create your own sounds from scratch or modify the existing presets to suit your needs. DiscoDSP Discovery Pro has a very intuitive and user-friendly interface that lets you access all the features and functions easily. You can see the four layers of the synth on the top panel, each with its own oscillator, filter, envelope, LFO, and effects. You can also see the global settings on the bottom panel, such as master volume, pitch bend range, polyphony mode, glide time, and more. You can also access the arpeggiator, the zone presets, and the MIDI XML board templates from here.
 
To create a sound with DiscoDSP Discovery Pro, you can start by choosing an oscillator type for each layer. You have 12 options to choose from: VA-Saw (a virtual analog sawtooth wave), VA-Square (a virtual analog square wave), VA-Triangle (a virtual analog triangle wave), VA-Sine (a virtual analog sine wave), VA-Pulse (a virtual analog pulse wave with pulse width modulation), VA-Noise (a virtual analog white noise generator), WAV (a wavetable oscillator that can load WAV files or SoundFonts), PADSynth (a special oscillator that uses additive synthesis to create rich and lush pads), FM (a frequency modulation oscillator that can create complex and metallic sounds), AM (an amplitude modulation oscillator that can create ring modulation effects), PM (a phase modulation oscillator that can create phase distortion effects), and Sync (an oscillator that can sync its frequency to another oscillator).

After choosing an oscillator type for each layer, you can adjust the parameters of each oscillator, such as volume, pan, tune, fine tune, phase offset, unison mode, unison detune, unison spread, unison phase randomization, and unison stereo width. You can also choose a filter type for each layer from 12 options: LP12 (a 12 dB/octave low-pass filter), LP24 (a 24 dB/octave low-pass filter), HP12 (a 12 dB/octave high-pass filter), HP24 (a 24 dB/octave high-pass filter), BP12 (a 12 dB/octave band-pass filter), BP24 (a 24 dB/octave band-pass filter), BR12 (a 12 dB/octave band-reject filter), BR24 (a 24 dB/octave band-reject filter), NL2 LP12 (a low-pass filter modeled after the Nord Lead 2), NL2 BP12 (a band-pass filter modeled after the Nord Lead 2), Moog LP24 (a low-pass filter modeled after the Moog ladder filter), and Moog HP24 (a high-pass filter modeled after the Moog ladder filter).
 
After choosing a filter type for each layer, you can adjust the parameters of each filter, such as cutoff frequency, resonance, key tracking amount, envelope amount, envelope polarity, LFO amount
