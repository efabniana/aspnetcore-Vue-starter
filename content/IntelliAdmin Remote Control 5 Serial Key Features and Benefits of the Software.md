To enter your serial key, launch IntelliAdmin Remote Control 5 and click on the "Help" menu at the top. Then select "Enter Serial Number" from the drop-down menu.

## Step 3: Connect to a Remote Computer

The final step is to connect to a remote computer that you want to control. You can do this in two ways: by typing its host name or IP address in the connect window, or by using the built-in search feature to find computers on your network.

To connect by typing the host name or IP address, launch IntelliAdmin Remote Control 5 and click on the "Connect" button at the top. A window will pop up where you can enter the host name or IP address of the remote computer. For example, if you want to connect to a computer with an IP address of 192.168.0.1, you can type it as follows:

    192.168.0.1

If the remote computer has a different port number than the default 2792 (TCP), you can specify it by adding a colon after the host name or IP address. For example, if you want to connect to a computer with an IP address of 192.168.0.1 on port 6000, you can type it as follows:

    192.168.0.1 8cf37b1e13
