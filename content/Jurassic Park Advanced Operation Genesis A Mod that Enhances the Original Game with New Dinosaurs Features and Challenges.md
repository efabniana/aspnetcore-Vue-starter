# Jurassic Park Advanced Operation Genesis: A Cancelled Mod That Promised a New Experience
 
Jurassic Park Advanced Operation Genesis (AOG) was a fan-made mod for the 2003 video game Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, which allowed players to create and manage their own dinosaur theme park. AOG aimed to improve the original game by adding new features, such as more dinosaurs, buildings, skins, sounds, and gameplay mechanics. AOG was in development for several years, but was ultimately cancelled in January 2020 due to various reasons.

According to the mod's official page on Mod DB[^1^], AOG was cancelled because of "a lack of motivation, time, and resources" among the developers. The mod also faced legal issues, as Universal Studios, the owner of the Jurassic Park franchise, issued a cease and desist letter to the mod team in 2018. The letter claimed that AOG violated Universal's intellectual property rights and demanded that the mod be taken down. The mod team complied with the letter and removed all downloads and media related to AOG from their website and social media accounts.
 
However, the mod team did not give up on their project completely. They decided to release some of their older work in progress builds to the public, so that fans of the mod could at least enjoy some of their efforts. The mod team also expressed their gratitude to their supporters and apologized for not being able to finish their mod. They stated that they hoped that someone else would take over their work and continue their vision of creating a new Jurassic Park experience.
