AutoCAD Raster Design 2014 is a powerful software that can help you work with raster images in various ways. You can use it to enhance the quality of scanned drawings, maps, aerial photos, satellite imagery, and digital elevation models. You can also use it to perform image processing, such as despeckle, bias, mirror, and invert. You can also apply filters, color adjustments, histograms, and transparency.
 
Another feature of AutoCAD Raster Design 2014 is the ability to convert raster data to vector data, and vice versa. This can help you create accurate and editable drawings from scanned images. You can use tools such as vectorization, polyline smoothing, raster entity manipulation, and raster underlay. You can also edit vector objects directly on raster images.
 
AutoCAD Raster Design 2014 is compatible with AutoCAD and other Autodesk products, such as AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map 3D, and AutoCAD Architecture. You can use it to integrate raster data with your CAD projects and workflows. You can also share your raster designs with others using standard file formats, such as TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
